title: Transitioning From Board Game Arena
---

<br />

## Introduction

This page is written for people who have a bunch of games on [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) and may be interested in playing some games with the _H-Group_ on [Hanab Live](https://www.hanab.live). This page is meant to help you assess your current "level". (It is also for current H-Group members to get a sense of what level BGA players are actually playing at.)

<br />

## Zamiel's Guide For BGA Players

It is highly recommended that you read [Zamiel's guide](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/BGA.md), which goes over some of the major website differences and major convention changes.

<br />

## What are Levels?

H-Group has a level system but **not** an ELO system. (Levels are for learning, not earning.) Players self assess their current knowledge according to the [learning path](learning-path.mdx#level-summary) and all players at the table are expected to play to the lowest level. Games are followed by a cooperative full game review in a Discord voice call. Beginners are met with patience. The levels help adjust expectations of all players, allow us to co-operate, and let us learn many complexities at a comfortable pace.

<br />

## What Level Am I?

While levels are not the focus of playing and learning this game, playing at an appropriate level is good etiquette and helps people learn more efficiently. As a BGA player, it may be difficult to assess your H-Group level, because you will likely know some of the higher conventions (like _Bluffs_, which is a level 10 convention) without being comfortable with the lower level conventions (like _Chop Focus_, which is a level 1 convention, or _Double Discard Avoidance_, which is a level 8 convention).

The H-Group learning path has 25 levels. Most experienced BGA players will begin comfortably at level 14, but with many holes in their knowledge. We call this _Convention Holes_. The "normal" [learning path](learning-path.mdx#level-summary) is listed below with some specific modifications: the important "holes" are colored in <span className="highlight">yellow</span>.

## How to Fill the Holes

### Option 1: Start at the Beginning

Start at level 1 like everyone else! The _H-Group_ is used to people going through the levels linearly. You will still patch the holes, with far less reading!

For this option, forget about _Bluffs_ and other advanced moves - keep things simple to master the fundamentals!

### Option 2: Begin Low

You may begin at whatever level from 1-14 that you are comfortable with. Make sure that you have at least read through each level and feel comfortable before attempting it.

When you join an _H-Group_ table, tell them that you are from BGA and which level you wish to try. (e.g. "level 6 with BGA experience", meaning that you might make some basic mistakes.) Feel free to link the table above, as it will be helpful for them too.

On the [_H-Group_ Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp), there might be people online who are people willing to play a BGA game with you: try pinging the @BGA role in the #general channel!

Starting too high might be frustrating for your teammates, as if you don't have the fundamentals down, none of the advanced stuff will work properly. Starting lower also means less reading!

We recommend starting at level 6 and giving special care and attention to _Chop Focus_ before moving onwards.

### Option 3: Level 14 with BGA Holes

The third option is to try and play at level 14 and fill in all of the "convention holes" all at once. (Level 14 is the level that introduces _Double Bluffs_, which is the "most advanced" BGA move.)

If you want to do this option, make sure that you:

- are an experienced BGA player
- have success with the "normal" conventions listed above
- have read the doc from level 1 to 14

By communicating to others that you are "level 14 with BGA holes", it will help them understand that you may have gaps in your knowledge.

<br />

### Remember...

... don't rush! Keep a pace that is comfortable. In general, we prefer that players stay at lower levels for a long time so that they can really get familiar with the fundamentals.

<br />

## After the Holes...

Once you have filled all holes to level 14, you can proceed more comfortably with the standard learning path.

Thank you so much for taking the time to play with the _H-Group_!
